Users will notice dotted lines on Trends, Funnel, and Retention graphs for ongoing time periods, such as the current day, week, etc. :sparkles:

This feature helps users

- :bulb: Understand that data for the particular period is still being collected and may change
- :muscle: Removes ambiguity and provides clarity when making decisions based on incomplete data

_**Note:** In addition, the default time granularity for Trends has been set to` Daily`._
