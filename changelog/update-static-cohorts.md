Users can now update previously added static cohorts (CSV uploads) on Houseware. :sparkles:

Use this feature to:

- :muscle: No longer create multiple instances of the same cohort to update its data
- :zap: Keep the team aligned by sharing and updating a single cohort for key analysis
- ðŸ§¹ Easily organize and reduce the clutter while maintaining cohorts

... and more!
