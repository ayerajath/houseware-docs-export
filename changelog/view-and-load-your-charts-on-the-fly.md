Users can now skip the wait and view their visualisations as soon as they open a workspace! :sparkles:

This update lets you

- 📦 View charts as soon as you open your workspace, as they are now stored in cache
- ⏳ See when your chart was last refreshed in the top right corner of your block
- 🔃 Re-load the blocks in your workspace, one at a time or all together, depending on what you need

These updates further enhance your experience and aim to optimize all workspaces for speed! 🚀
