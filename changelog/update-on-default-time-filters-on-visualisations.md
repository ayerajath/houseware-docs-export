Going forward, all newly created charts will automatically come with a default time filter of last 3 days. :sparkles:

:point-right: If the above is cleared and no new filter is configured, it will switch to the last 30 days.

:point-right: Users can still configure the time filters as per their requirements.

This change has been made to enhance your experience on Houseware further and optimize the default configuration for speed! :rocket:

_**Note: **The Maximum date range on time filters for Flows remains 14 days._

_**Note:** For Stickiness charts, last 3 day's dates will be applied automatically instead of the "Last 3 days" filter_
