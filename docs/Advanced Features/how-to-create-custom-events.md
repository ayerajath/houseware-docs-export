A custom event is a virtual event that can be created from one or more existing events, filtered down by their properties. Custom events help in:

1. Merging two or more events together into a single event. For example, "user signup" + "account created" can be merged as a single "signup" event.
2. Filtering an event to create a new event. For example, users who have signed up from the website like: "user signup" or "account created" with property filter 'source' as "website". 

Custom events provide flexibility to users to create their own KPIs on top of the existing granular events, relevant for their analysis. Let's look at how we actually create a custom event in Houseware.

## Step 3: Select events and filters

After clicking the + custom event button on the events page, you will be redirected to a new page that will allow you to configure your custom event.

On this page, you can give your custom event a name and description and then select the events that you want to combine or filter to create your desired custom event.
