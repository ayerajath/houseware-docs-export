"There are no shortcuts to success" - well, sometimes there can be. Find yourself stuck? Fast Navigation and Help is a command (K) away.

Accelerate your navigation by using Command K (on Mac) or Control K (on Windows) shortcut on your system to move through the product. Access pages, workspaces, and apps faster than ever, and also leave us feedback with an option in the menu.

It can also be accessed through the :zap: icon that you see on the bottom left of the product, as shown in the screenshot below.

Once you click the button/use the keyboard prompt, the following menu will open. It has separate sections for **navigation** and **help**, along with a **search bar** at the top, as shown in the screenshot below.

You can also access particular workspaces and apps faster by using the `/workspaces` and `/blocks` in the search bar, type the name of the workspace or block you are specifically looking for. No more endless scrolling to reach your destination!

        "",
        "`/workspaces` and `/block` command to search specifically"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "600px",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "`/workspaces` and `/block` command to search specifically"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Lastly, you can exit the menu by using the `esc` key, or simply by clicking anywhere on the screen. Explore and Create Away!
