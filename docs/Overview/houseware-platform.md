# Data Platform

Houseware's data platform is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and secure environment for product analytics. A warehouse-native architecture demanded a unique perspective at building multiple workloads, that worked agnostic of the storage layer or the query engines. 

Listed below are some of the workloads supported by the Data Platform

## Data Schema

Houseware employs an activity schema-esque data schema that organizes events into a set of mandatory and optional attributes. This enables:

- **Scalability**: Efficiently handles large volumes (up to tens of billions) of event data at runtime. The schema supports high-throughput data ingestion and processing, maintaining robust performance as data scales.
- **Flexibility**: Accommodates new event types and attributes without requiring schema changes. This allows for seamless integration of new data points as the product evolves, avoiding extensive redesigns.
- **Simplicity**: The schema is user-friendly and adaptable to various scenarios, making it easy to model and query data. It minimizes the learning curve for users and simplifies data management.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes query performance by structuring data for fast retrieval and analysis. The schema supports efficient indexing, clustering and partitioning, which speeds up query execution times.
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform data formatting and structuring across the organization. This standardization simplifies data integration, governance, and compliance.
- **Reduced Complexity**: Minimizes the complexity of data transformations by using a straightforward schema that maps easily to various data sources. This simplification accelerates the ETL process and reduces the potential for errors.

## Metadata:

Metadata in Houseware refers to data about events/entities. It serves several critical functions:

- **Query Optimization**: Enhances query performance by providing statistics, indexing information, and other query-related metadata. This allows the query engine to make informed decisions about query execution plans, improving efficiency and reducing execution times.
- **Incremental Processing**: Tracks changes and updates in data, enabling efficient incremental query processing. By identifying and processing only the data that has changed since the last update, it minimizes data reprocessing and reduces load on the data warehouse.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Metadata allows users to know specific details about their event names, event dimensions, user properties, date ranges, hence informing the users about the available options for analysis.

### Key Metadata Components

- **Dimensions**: Metadata about event attributes that are first-class columns in the events table. This includes information such as the dimension name, possible values, data type, and cardinality.
- **Event Names and Properties**: Metadata about event names and their associated properties, including property values, data types, and cardinality. This is stored in a dedicated table to facilitate efficient querying and analysis.
- **Event Time Range**: Metadata about the earliest and latest timestamps of events, allowing for time-based filtering and analysis. This is essential for temporal queries and understanding data recency.
- **First-Time Event Mapping**: Tracks the first occurrence of specific events for each user, enabling analysis of first-time user actions. This mapping is crucial for understanding user onboarding and initial interactions.
- **ID Mapping**: Maps device identifiers to user identifiers, resolving multiple occurrences of events from different devices to a single user. This ensures accurate user tracking and analysis.
- **Custom Enrichment**: Allows users to add custom metadata such as event tags, descriptions, and dimension types, enhancing the analytical capabilities and contextual understanding of the data.

## Real-Time Analytics

Realtime analytics in Houseware enables immediate data processing and analysis, providing up-to-date insights as data is generated. This capability is essential for applications requiring timely decision-making based on the latest events.

Realtime analytics is achieved through continuous data ingestion, processing, and querying. Data is streamed from various sources into the data warehouse, where it is immediately available for analysis.

### Architecture

The reference architecture for realtime analytics in Houseware, supporting both BigQuery and Snowflake, is as follows:

- **Data Ingestion**: Data is continuously ingested from various sources, such as user interactions, IoT devices, or application logs. This data is sent to a cloud storage service like Google Cloud Storage (GCS) or AWS S3.
- **Data Processing Pipeline**:
  - GCP DataFlow: For environments using BigQuery, GCP DataFlow processes the ingested data in real-time, applying necessary transformations such as parsing, filtering, and enrichment.
  - AWS Kinesis / Apache Kafka: For environments using Snowflake, streaming data is processed using AWS Kinesis or Apache Kafka with AWS Lambda or Apache Flink for transformations.
- **Metadata Update:** As new data arrives, metadata in the warehouse is updated in real-time. This includes updating dimension tables, event names, and property values, ensuring that the latest data is available for querying.

## Caching

Houseware employs multiple caching strategies to enhance performance for end users of the platform:

- **Application Cache**: Caches visualization queries and metadata requests to reduce load on the warehouse and improve response times. Visualization queries are cached for 365 days, while metadata queries are cached for 1 hour.
- **Warehouse Cache**: Utilizes native warehouse caching mechanisms (e.g., Snowflake's result cache, local disk cache, and remote disk cache) to speed up queries.

## Deployment models for "Query Compute"

Houseware offers flexible deployment models to suit different organizational needs. While the customer connects their own data warehouse, they still have the flexibility to choose between the following models:

**Bring-your-own-Compute**: In the Bring-your-own-Compute model, customers utilize their existing data warehouse compute resources for query execution. This model provides several advantages:

- Control: Customers maintain full control over their compute resources, allowing them to manage performance, scaling, and cost directly.
- Optimization: Enables customers to optimize query execution based on their specific workload and performance requirements.
- Integration: Seamlessly integrates with existing data governance and security policies within the customer's environment.

**Houseware-Compute**: In the Houseware-Compute model, Houseware leverages "Snowflake Secure Data Sharing" or "BigQuery Data Sharing" to simplify the compute process for customers. In this model, Houseware absorbs the compute costs and abstracts it away from the customer. Key benefits include:

- Simplified Management: Customers do not need to manage or optimize compute resources, as Houseware handles all aspects of query execution.
- Cost Efficiency: Houseware absorbs the compute costs, providing a predictable pricing model and reducing the customer's operational overhead.

## Identity Resolution

Houseware provides advanced identity resolution capabilities to unify user identities across different data sources, helpful for digital applications where non-loggedin user behavior is critical to their product flows.

- **Device and User ID Mapping**: Houseware's algorithms map device identifiers to user identifiers to track user activities across multiple devices. This mapping enables accurate tracking and analysis of user behavior, even when users switch between devices, ensuring accurate user insights.
- **First-Time Event Mapping**: Houseware identifies the first occurrence of specific events for each user. This mapping helps in understanding user onboarding and initial interactions with the product, which is crucial for optimizing user experience and engagement strategies.

## Cost Management (Budgeting, Quotas, and Cost Observability)

Houseware offers robust tools to manage and observe costs associated with data processing and analytics. These capabilities ensure that customers can maintain fine-grained control over their data warehouse expenditures while optimizing query performance.

- **Cost Observability**: Costs are broken down by specific query patterns, allowing customers to see which queries or analytical operations are consuming the most resources. The platform continuously monitors compute costs and detects anomalies. If there is an unusual spike or unexpected pattern in costs, alerts are sent to the designated Slack channels, enabling prompt investigation and resolution.
- **Budgeting & Quotas**: Customers can define usage quotas and budgets directly on their Data Warehouse(Snowflake/BigQuery). Budgets can be defined for overall data warehouse usage as well as for specific query types or runtimes. This helps in tracking and controlling spending, ensuring that costs remain within the planned limits.

## Query Observability

The Houseware Data Platform has internal query observability to monitor and optimize query performance. These capabilities ensure that queries run efficiently, resource usage is optimized, and any issues are quickly identified and resolved.

**Query Logging** Houseware tracks and logs all query executions, providing a detailed record of each query's lifecycle:

- Execution Tracking: Logs the start time, end time, and duration of each query, along with the query text and execution context.
- Error Logging: Captures any errors or exceptions that occur during query execution, facilitating troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
- User and Session Information: Logs metadata about the user and session that initiated the query, helping to correlate queries with specific users or applications.

These logs provide a comprehensive history of query activity, which is essential for both performance analysis and security auditing.

**Performance Metrics**: Houseware collects detailed performance metrics for each query, enabling the identification and resolution of performance bottlenecks:

- Resource Utilization: Tracks metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and I/O operations for each query.
- Execution Plan Analysis: Analyzes the execution plan of each query to identify inefficiencies, such as suboptimal joins or missing indexes.
- Latency Metrics: Measures the response times and latency of queries to ensure they meet performance expectations.
