In Houseware, Cohorts are a group of users that share common characteristics. They are super useful to analyze your data only for a particular set of users. It is an ideal combination of user properties and actual event-based behavior on the product. To know more about it, refer to [building blocks of Houseware](https://ayerajath.github.io/houseware-docs-export/docs/building-blocks-of-houseware#cohorts).

*Cohorts page on Houseware*


Cohorts can be super helpful if you want to restrict your analysis only to a specific set of users. And that specific set emerges from a combination of user properties and events behavior. The users create cohorts by applying appropriate filters (AND, OR, both can be used) on top of user properties and event behavior, or a combination of both.

1. **User properties.** For example, city, region, plan type, device type, etc.
2. **Event behavior.** For example, users who click on in-app notifications.

Without any further delay, let's deep-dive into how to ðŸ¥£ create cohorts and use them on Houseware.

***

# Step-by-step guide

Follow the steps listed below to create a cohort on Houseware

## Step 1: Click on the Cohorts tab

Once you log in to your Houseware instance, click on the **Cohorts** tab on the left-hand navigation panel. It will take you to Houseware's Cohorts page.

On this page, you will be able to see the name of your cohort, a short description (as added by the creator), the user who created it, the date of creation, and a link to share it with your colleagues. 

## Step 2: Click on the +New Cohort button

- Click on the **+New Cohort **button adjacent to the search bar at the top of the page. 
- You will be directed to the **Create Cohort** page as soon as you click.

## Step 3: Add name and description

- Give your cohort an appropriate name and description. Even though the description is not a mandatory field, adding it will help you understand what your Cohort is about.
- Add filters that will help you create your cohort.

## Step 4: Choose appropriate filters

A filter group is a set of filters that you define that are all connected by "And" - meaning a user qualifies as part of it if they satisfy all the filters within it. 

A cohort can have multiple filter groups which will be connected by "Or", meaning a user will be part of the Cohort if they satisfy the criteria for any of the filter groups.

There are two types of filters:

1. User Properties: These filters start with `Where`.
2. Events: These filters start with `Who`.

### User Properties:

- Select user properties from the filter drop-down menu. 
- It will show user properties and their values to select from the drop-down menu, as shown in the gif below.

### Events Behavior:

The entire event filter is divided into 6 parts.

1. **did or did not**: To choose if you want to filter by users who did or did not do the selected event
2. **Event name**: The event already selected in the drop-down shows up in this part.
3. **Aggregate function**: By default, it is selected as count, as it will count the number of users.
4. **Counting criteria**: Choose the condition according to which you want the users to be counted. Like - `is`, `is not`, `greater than`, \``greater than equals`, `less than`, etc.
5. **Additional counting criteria**: If you want to add more than 1 counting criterion, add it in the 5th part.
6. **Time**: Select the time period for the event to have been triggered. For example, 1 day, 7 days, 28 days, etc.

> âœ¨ **Nested filters**: In the same filter, more details about the event or user property can be added by clicking on the `+ Filter` option given on the right-side of your filter statement. For example, users who clicked Joint Plan should belong to the plan `basic`. This information can be added using the `+ Filter` option.

> ðŸŒŸ **Feature Highlight**: Multiple AND or OR filters can be added by clicking on the `Add Filters` button below, which allows creation of complex cohorts, as shown in the gif below.

*Add an AND filter to create a cohort*


To make sure that you do not make mistakes while combining the `AND` and `OR` filters, the `AND` filters are given precedence and hence stuck together, in the same box, whereas `OR` is separated.

![The `OR` filter group is separated, whereas the `AND` filter group is stuck together](https://files.readme.io/fc68d91-Screenshot_2023-09-20_at_1.50.53_AM.png)

*The `OR` filter group is separated, whereas the `AND` filter group is stuck together*


Just like in arithmetic operators, if the brackets are missing, then an expression as given below might lead to different results:

- 1 + 2 \* 3 = 7 
- 1 \* 2 + 3 = 5

Similarly, to make sure that the user gets the intended number of users in their cohorts, a visual hierarchy that separates the `AND` and `OR` filters ensure accuracy in the cohort creation process.

Also, within the same filter group, to ensure accuracy, you can only apply either `AND` or  `OR` filters if there are more than two filters in the same filter group.

For example, if you want to create a cohort of users who did start a training or end a training but did not share their achievement, this is how you will create it:

> ðŸ‘€ **Note:** As you can see in the GIF above, inside the same filter group, which means at the same hierarchy, we cannot have both `AND` and `OR`. Hence, to add an `OR` filter, we use the Add filter group option.

## Step 5: Click on the Save button

Click on the `Save` button and :tada: your cohort is created, saved, and ready to be used!

You can now use this cohort to use as a breakdown or filter in visualizations like Funnels and Trends, as shown in the gif below.
