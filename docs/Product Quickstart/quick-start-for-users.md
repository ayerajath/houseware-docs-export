As you log in, you will be straightaway directed to your workspaces, as shown below. You will be able to see the pre-existing workspaces that have been either created or shared with you.

> ðŸŒŸ **Pro-tip**: Click "Go to Workspaces" on the top right corner here to go to the Workspaces page. You can access the "Getting started" page again from the top right corner of the Workspaces tab.

</br>

Inside each workspace, a block such as - text, visualizations, embeds, etc. can be added to curate your product analytics workspace as required. Below is a screenshot of a demo workspace containing the block type - `visualization` which can be used to create powerful product analytics visualizations like trends, funnels, flows, etc.

To know more about how to create these powerful visualizations, [read here](https://ask.houseware.io/en/collections/4532076-analysis).

</br>

On the left-hand side is a workspace index, which helps you quickly navigate through your workspace and move between different blocks based on their names.

Apart from the workspaces, the nav bar on the left-hand side will let you access other pages like events, cohorts, user activity, etc. that will help you understand the event data connected with your Houseware instance to power visualizations on your workspaces.
