Events are one of the core building blocks of Houseware. An event is a data point representing each unique action the user takes on your product. For example, clicking the 'start workout' button on a fitness app will be recorded as an event.

Once your [events data is connected with Houseware](https://docs.houseware.io/docs/how-to-connect-your-product-data-to-houseware), all your events will be auto-populated on your Houseware instance. Let's quickly look into how these events and their corresponding details be viewed in Houseware.
