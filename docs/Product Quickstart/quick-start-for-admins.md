      "sizing": "600px",
      "border": true,

    }

Let's understand the details of each section.

## Users Tab

        "https://files.readme.io/460b245-Screenshot_2023-10-30_at_6.25.50_PM.png",
        "",
        "Invite new users"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "600px",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Invite new users"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The Users section lists all invited users on Houseware. New users can be invited by admin from the `Users` tab only. 

### Step 1: Click on `+ Invite user button`

Click on the `+ Invite user` button to send an invitation to the new user.

### Step 2: Click on `+ Send invite`

        "",
        "New user invite modal"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "600px",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "New user invite modal"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The Users tab also allows the admin to switch user roles across users between members and admins.

        "",
        "Select user roles"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "600px",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Select user roles"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## Events Tab

On the events tab, an admin can add event descriptions and event tags, which are useful to add more context to the events and also make them easy to search.

[block:image]

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/ef702dc-Screenshot_2023-10-30_at_6.35.26_PM.png",
        "",
        "Add descriptions and tags from the admin centre"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "600px",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Add descriptions and tags from the admin center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> ‚ú® **Pro-tip:**Event tags are super useful to discover events quickly. Hence, always add event tags, make them contextual to the business, so that the end-user is able to understand and identify event easily. These tags are also visible on the events page, and can be used to search faster on the search bar as shown in the image below.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/c712614-Screenshot_2023-10-30_at_6.50.47_PM.png",
        "",
        "Search events using tags"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "600px",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Search events using tags"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Watch below how an admin can add tags and descriptions to their events.

{
  "html": "<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: calc(59% + 41px); height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://demo.arcade.software/hZiJeuiDRWK25GFJo2Vj?embed\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;color-scheme: light;\"></iframe></div>"
}
[/block]
