## Overview

Access control helps organizations protect sensitive data, maintain confidentiality, prevent unauthorized modifications or deletions, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. It also enables efficient collaboration by allowing the right people to access and work on the resources they need while keeping others out.

Use Access Controls on Houseware to decide whether others can view/edit your Workspace. 

Let's see how it works! ⚙️

***

## What are the different types of access you can give?

Once you've created a Workspace, you are declared its Owner. You have the ability to add another user as a Viewer or Editor. By default, only you have access to your created Workspace. You can add particular users or even update access at the level of the organization, as you will see ahead.

The following table shows you the kind of access each type mentioned above has:

|                    | Owner | Editor | Viewer | Restricted |
| :----------------- | :---- | :----- | :----- | :--------- |
| Delete Workspace   | ✅     | ❌      | ❌      | ❌          |
| Create Blocks      | ✅     | ✅      | ❌      | ❌          |
| Edit Blocks        | ✅     | ✅      | ❌      | ❌          |
| View Blocks        | ✅     | ✅      | ✅      | ❌          |
| Delete Blocks      | ✅     | ✅      | ❌      | ❌          |
| Rearrange Blocks   | ✅     | ✅      | ❌      | ❌          |
| Update User Access | ✅     | ✅      | ❌      | ❌          |
| Clone              | ✅     | ✅      | ❌      | ❌          |
| Comment            | ✅     | ✅      | ❌      | ❌          |
| Add to Favorites   | ✅     | ✅      | ✅      | ❌          |

> 👀 **Note:**Someone having access to a workspace does not automatically have access to all the Workspaces within. That has to be updated manually.
