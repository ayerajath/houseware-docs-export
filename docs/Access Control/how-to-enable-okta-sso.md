Houseware uses [WorkOS](@https://workos.com/) for SSO. WorkOS is a modern API platform that empowers any developer to quickly build and ship enterprise features: [Single Sign-On (SAML)](@https://workos.com/single-sign-on), [Directory Sync (SCIM)](@https://workos.com/directory-sync), and [Admin Portal (enterprise onboarding)](@https://workos.com/admin-portal).

WorkOS accelerates SaaS companies like Houseware in their journey to become Enterprise-Ready, so their app has all the features to be adopted 'wall-to-wall' in a large organization. It is trusted by leading SaaS organizations like Vercel, Hopin, Loom, Pitch, Drata, and Webflow.

To enable Okta SSO for Houseware:

1. Contact your Houseware success manager for a WorkOS magic link.
2. Use the magic link on WorkOS to set up an Okta application for Houseware.
3. Your Houseware workspace is now Okta enabled! ðŸŽ‰ 

You can add users in your organization to the Okta application to grant them access to the Houseware application.
